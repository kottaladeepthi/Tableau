🌟 Presenting My Stock Performance Dashboard! 🌟 

My latest Tableau project—a Stock Performance Dashboard that analyzes the last year’s performance of tech giants like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Okta, and Tesla! 

💡 What’s Inside the Dashboard?
Using Google Sheets and the Google Finance function, I collected real-time stock data for the past year (January 2024–December 2024). Then, I brought the data to life with Tableau to deliver actionable insights and a sleek, interactive interface. 

🔍 Visual Highlights:
- Stock Area Chart: To visualize trends and fluctuations in stock prices. 
- Profit & Loss Numbers: Breaking down gains and losses for each stock. 
- Volatility Bubble Chart: Highlighting stock volatility over the year. 
- Portfolio Line Chart: Showcasing overall portfolio growth. 
- Volatility Chart: Analyzing periods of high and low volatility. 
- Lollipop Chart: For a unique and visually engaging comparison of performance metrics. 
- Portfolio Value Cards: Displaying the total value of the portfolio at a glance. 
- Profit/Loss Percentage Charts: For quick insights into overall performance. 

🌟 Learning Takeaways: 
This project allowed me to: 
- Automate data collection with Google Sheets and the Google Finance function. 
- Design advanced Data Visualizations to make financial analysis intuitive. 
- Deliver insights on market trends and portfolio performance to drive better decision-making.
