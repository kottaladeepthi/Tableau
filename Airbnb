Data Visualization in Action: Airbnb Analysis with Tableau! 

Excited to share my recent **Airbnb data analysis project**, where I used **Tableau** to uncover key insights! 

Key Visualizations:
✅ Average Price per Bedroom – Understanding pricing trends based on property size.  
✅ Revenue by Year – Analyzing annual performance and growth patterns.  
✅ Price by ZIP Code – Identifying high and low-value rental areas.  

This project allowed me to enhance my data storytelling skills and extract valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
